Terraform module to provision a VPC with Internet Gateway. Contains a submodule for provisioning Interface and/or Gateway VPC Endpoints.
This module also supports provisioning additional CIDR blocks for the VPC, with or without using [IPAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/ipam/what-it-is-ipam.html).


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Examples

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "cloudposse/vpc/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version = "x.x.x"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "test"
  name      = "app"

  ipv4_primary_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

  assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = true
}
```

Full example with [`terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets.git):

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source = "cloudposse/vpc/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  namespace = "eg"
  stage     = "test"
  name      = "app"

  ipv4_primary_cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16"

  assign_generated_ipv6_cidr_block = false
}

module "dynamic_subnets" {
  source = "cloudposse/dynamic-subnets/aws"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"
  namespace          = "eg"
  stage              = "test"
  name               = "app"
  availability_zones = ["us-west-2a","us-west-2b","us-west-2c"]
  vpc_id             = module.vpc.vpc_id
  igw_id             = [module.vpc.igw_id]
  cidr_block         = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```

Submodule for provisioning VPC Endpoints:

```hcl
module "vpc_endpoints" {
  source = "cloudposse/vpc/aws//modules/vpc-endpoints"
  # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
  # version     = "x.x.x"

  vpc_id = module.vpc.vpc_id

  gateway_vpc_endpoints = {
    "s3" = {
      name = "s3"
      policy = jsonencode({
        Version = "2012-10-17"
        Statement = [
          {
            Action = [
              "s3:*",
            ]
            Effect    = "Allow"
            Principal = "*"
            Resource  = "*"
          },
        ]
      })
    }
  }
  interface_vpc_endpoints = {
    "ec2" = {
      name                = "ec2"
      security_group_ids  = ["sg-12341234123412345"]
      subnet_ids          = module.dynamic_subnets.private_subnet_ids
      policy              = null
      private_dns_enabled = false
    }
  }
}
```
