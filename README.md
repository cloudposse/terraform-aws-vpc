This project is part of our comprehensive ["SweetOps"](https://docs.cloudposse.com) approach towards DevOps. 


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).














## Examples

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "app"
}
```

Full example with [`terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets`](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets.git):

```hcl
module "vpc" {
  source    = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-vpc.git?ref=master"
  namespace = "cp"
  stage     = "prod"
  name      = "app"
}

module "dynamic_subnets" {
  source             = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-dynamic-subnets.git?ref=master"
  namespace          = "cp"
  stage              = "prod"
  name               = "app"
  region             = "us-west-2"
  availability_zones = ["us-west-2a","us-west-2b","us-west-2c"]
  vpc_id             = "${module.vpc.vpc_id}"
  igw_id             = "${module.vpc.igw_id}"
  cidr_block         = "10.0.0.0/16"
}
```
