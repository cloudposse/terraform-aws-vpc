# These resources are in outputs.tf because they are solely for producing output

#  After endpoints are created via Terraform, some additional resources are provisioned by AWS
#  that do not immediately appear in the resource, and therefore would not appear in the output
#  of the resources attributes. Examples include private DNS entries and Network Interface IDs.
#  We cannot refresh the resources and prevent Terraform from showing drift after creation,
#  but we can wait and populate the output from data sources to capture this additional information.
