    - `security_group_ids`: The ID of one or more security groups to associate with the network interface. The first
      security group will replace the default association with the VPC's default security group. If you want

    After endpoints are created via Terraform, some additional resources are provisioned by AWS

    This input (in `go` duration format) sets a time delay to allow for such activity, after which
    the endpoint data is fetched via data sources for output.
